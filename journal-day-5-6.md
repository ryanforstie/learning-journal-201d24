## Day 5-6:
- On day 5 I had National Guard duty so that put a wrench in my plans. But After catching up Friday was not horrible and creating working branches is an easy concept to grasp. With that came more git commands and I really need to make some cheat sheets for that.
- Day 6 was brutal, we started using the DOM and making collectible data using math random function. One takeaway is to break down your code like putting together a puzzle, outline from big to small to smaller yet. Lastly, the light at the end of the tunnel is familiarity. Although the lab sucked and was very hard and I needed help the more I work and become familiar with this code the better off ill be.
