## Day 9-10
- The past 2 days have been a little bit of a deload. Started learning the wireframing process which makes alot more sense than the way I was doing it before. We will finish the exercise on Monday. It starts with writing all of the html and assigning classes that will help you structure the CSS. After that you than style the page with CSS.

- I still have alot to learn with CSS and how to structure a webpage. I started to learn flexbox which helps alot with the layout of the page.

- Starting watching youtube videos that help me learn more in regard to HTML, CSS and JS.
