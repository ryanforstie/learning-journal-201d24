## Day 11-12

 - Its the end of day 11 of class and its really late right now. Past midnight and I could finish my lab so im calling it quits and going to bed.
 - Worked on bus-mall and finally finished was super hard.
 - Added in a chart using chart.js on there website they have instructions on how to put in there js code. You have to link it to your html head, and make a canvas element. Read the docs closely they have all the answers on how to work the chart.
