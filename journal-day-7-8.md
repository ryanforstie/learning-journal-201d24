## Day 7-8
- This week was brutal. We started the cookie store project. Learned how to work the DOM, first in a list and second in a table.
  - Create an element, give it content and append it to a certain place in the DOM.
  - I am still trying to wrap my brain around this concept, but the more I use it and become familiar with it the better off ill be.

- We have learned so much this week so I will start rattling off in no order - Debugging: Use console.log, console.table, on the browser you can mark pause points under source tab, use this to check if code is doing what its suppose too.
- JS events element.addEventListner('type', handlerFunction)
- New website, CodePen
- Git merge conflicts: go to master branch, pull origin master to see merge conflict, open atom, should see color coded code, click what code to use and save, ACP, go to GH and merge.
- Code organization: 1. set up data(var's, functions,) 2. define your behaviors/actions(declare functions, handlers) 3. execute code(function call(), event listners)
- Wire Framing: shows all dimensions, image sizes, place holder images(placeholder.com), place holder text(lorem ipsum).
- 1. Do HTML first, CSS layout, Work CSS top to bottom, placehold.it for img.
