201 Learning Journal

# July 11th, 2017:
## Day 1:
- The first day was a good introduction to the 201 course. I learned many things. First, how adults learn using the learning pyramid, andragogy, and paths to sandboxes.
- How Git works by seeing a diagram on google. The never ending ACP.
- Break code down into small steps to solve, have cheats sheets, and play Git game.
- We also learned a list of terminal commands and keyboard shortcuts. We also reviewed web page structure, TREE, BOXES diagrams for visualization.
- The dark pages in the books are the most important, and understand the chapter summary to get the gist of the chapter.

## Day 2:
- Covered the assigned reading -- <h1-h3> headings are used to structure the web page.
- Block - start on high left as possible, fill entire line.
- Inline - sit side by side, content determines width.
- The best sources to use when googling 1. MDN is what the pros use, 2. Stack overflow - Has every question and answer on coding, look at date and up votes, 3. W3 - the fast and dirty answer.
- MISC. - camelCase - JS, what-about-kabob-case - html, git clone
- ACP - git add . - git commit -m "comments" - git push to origin master
