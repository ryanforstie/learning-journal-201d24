## Day 18-19

- I had National Guard duty so I missed Friday and now I am trying to remember everthing that I learned. Working in a group has been super fun and helpful. Planning out our plan on a whiteboard so we could see and visualize what we needed to do was very good. Pair programming is a great way to work on code, you also can learn alot from the other person. I got to observe my group members practice there presentations, and practicing the presentation is super important.
