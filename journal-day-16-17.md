## Day 16-17

- Project week has been fun so far. I learned alot about the planning process and how to make a plan. We set up a repo on github and started using the project planning section. Monday was a huge planning day and we used the whiteboard which helped alot.

- Tuesday was a big build out day. We almost finished the mvp for each page. Still have some work to do but we are getting there.
