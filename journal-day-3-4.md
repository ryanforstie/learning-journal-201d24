## Day 3-4:
- Learned alot in the pass 2 days and ill list them out.
- Loops: we started to use loops and they make life easier because of the repeating effect. For loops are the way to go it seems.
- We used if/else statements, these can be fun to use because of the logic.
- Control Flow: This will wrap about the tecniques involed - for loops - if/else - while loops. They all have a different purpose.
- Basic control flow, psuedo code and drawing out the code you are going to write is an awesome tactic.

- CSS layout is was a good chapter for page layout. Still very crappy at css and need alot of work on it.
- Pair Programming - Was a good experience, the use of arrays and functions reduced my code by alot. The process of using GH, from fork to finish was very good training. The graphical dictation was very helpful.
